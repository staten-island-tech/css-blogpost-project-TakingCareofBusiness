                <img src="BattleofBlibblesField.png" alt="Victory Image of the Battle of Blibbles Field" class="article-cover">
                <p class="text">Finally ending after 4 days of battle, the Joy Coalition, composed of the forces of Glaggleland, Glooberland, Gemboland, and what remains of Gazoland, achived victory over Enphoso and his forces. With around 800,000  troops in the coalition and an estimated 1.1 million Enphosians, it was a miracle from the Peripheral Glag himself that the Enphosian forces were able to be defeated. After the destruction of Gazoland, which started the battle, Glaggles everywhere can feel safe, with Enphoso himself being sighted retreating to the Enphosian Pyramidian, along with his forces. Look out for a time of peace, coming to everywhere near you!</p>
